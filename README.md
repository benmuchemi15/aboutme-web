# aboutme-web

This is a read me on the aboutme-web repository

When you click the home button at the top right, you will be taken to the "home" part of the web page
My name at the left of the page will also redirect you back to the top of the page

The about button will take you to the about section that talks about my road to being a web developer


The contact buton will take you the contact section of my page
I linked my phone number and emai using the <a href> element so that when you click the link you can email or call me directly without having to open up your email or phone

I made sure to have a footer as a footer is essential to any web page
